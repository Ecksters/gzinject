## About

gzinject is used to extract the contents of a wad and pack it back into a wad with any changes that have been made.
While this will work for *most* WADs, it is designed to work primarily with the Ocarina of Time wad in order to inject
gz (the practice rom). 

## Usage 

```
Usage: gzinject -a,--action=(genkey | extract | pack) [options]
  options:
    -a, --action (genkey | extract | pack)		Defines the action to run
      genkey: generates a common key
      extract: extracts contents of wadfile specified by --wad to --directory
      pack: packs contents --directory  into wad specified by --wad
    -w, --wad wadfile					Defines the wadfile to use Input wad for extracting, output wad for packing
    -d, --directory directory				Defines the output directory for extract operations, or the input directory for pack operations
    -i, --channelid channelid				Changes the channel id during packing (4 characters)
    -t, --channeltitle channeltitle			Changes the channel title during packing (max 20 characters)
    -r, --region [0-3]					Changes the WAD region during packing 0 = JP, 1 = US, 2 = Europe, 3 = FREE
	--raphnet					Maps Z To L instead of c-stick down, for N64->GC Raphnet Adapters
    -k, --key keyfile					Uses the specified common key file
